# Optimal Bayes Estimators for Latent Position Network Models

This repo contains a research project on Latent Position Network Models took place in summer 2019. The goal of this project was to develop a mathematical method with Game Theory and Bayes Risks Theory to compare and optimise Latent Position Network Models. This project was written in R.
